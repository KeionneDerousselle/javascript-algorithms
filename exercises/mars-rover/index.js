/**
 * NASA wants to deploy rovers to Mars to research a plateau.
 * NASA will send you a list of instructions, showing you how to place rovers and move them to specified locations on the plateau.

 * The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation.
 * The plateau starts at (0, 0) in the bottom left corner.
 * NASA will send you to total size of the plateau, it's upper bounds in the top right corner.

 * A rover’s position and location will be represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates
 * and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. ( 1 2 N )
 * An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.

 * In order to control a rover , NASA sends a simple string of letters.
 * The possible letters are ‘L’, ‘R’ and ‘M’.
 * ‘L’ and ‘R’ makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot.
 * ‘M’ means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.

 *  The Input:
 * 5 5
 * 1 2 N
 * LMLMLMLMM
 * 3 3 E
 * MMRMMRMRRM

 * Should Produce:
 * 1 3 N
 * 5 1 E
