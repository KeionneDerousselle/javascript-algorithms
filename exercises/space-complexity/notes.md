# Space Complexity
Space Complexity defines a formula which describes the relationship between the input and the amount of storage it takes in memory to perform an algorithm.

The steps problem would have n^2 space complexity.

Something linear normally has linear space complexity.

How much more memory is required by doubling the problem set?
